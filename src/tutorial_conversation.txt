If you press 'f', you will be able to switch between controlling Tracy and myself. And I can jump higher than Tracy.
I still have no idea who you're talking to.

Uh, Biggie? How are we supposed to get up there?
If you press 'l' while underneath, I transform into a ladder.

If you press 'b', I transform into a bridge.


Biggie. There's a monster there.
I know.
Let's go back. I don't want to be here anymore.
Come on Tracy. Just follow my lead. We'll just jump over it and run.
