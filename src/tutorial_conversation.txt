Ah, Tracy! Welcome!
Biggie? What are you doing here?
I'm here to give the player a tutorial
Huh? What do you mean?
I mean, you should really use the arrow keys to move, and the space bar to jump.
Arrow keys?
Don't worry. It'll work out.

If you press 'f', you will be able to switch between controlling Tracy and myself. And I can jump higher than Tracy.
I still have no idea who you're talking to.

Uh, Biggie? How are we supposed to get up there?
If you press 'l' while underneath, I transform into a ladder.

If you press 'b', I transform into a bridge.


Biggie. There's a monster there.
I know.
Let's go back. I don't want to be here anymore.
Come on Tracy. Just follow my lead. We'll just jump over it and run.
